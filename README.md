# bootstrap.sh
A collection of minimal scripts to manage various operations in a startup/self-hosted environment.

Most of the scripts are self-explanatory.

The best tech stack to run apps in a self-hosted environment is:

1. pm2 - To run servers in production.
2. nginx - To act as a reverse proxy for your servers.
3. LetsEncrypt - Free and secure SSL for your servers.
